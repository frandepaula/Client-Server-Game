# :video_game: Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe Game using Client/Server Architecture and Sockets in C
This is a simple implementation of a multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game using client/server architecture and sockets. Players can connect to a central server, and the game progresses as they take turns making moves on the shared board.
## Execution
1. Compile the server:
   ```
   $gcc -o server server.c
    $./server <PORT>
   ```
2. Compile the client:
   ```
   $gcc -o client client.c
    $./client <PORT>
   ```
